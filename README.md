# League Of Skins

- An app that lets you view skins for League of Legends characters
- This app began as an experiment with the League of Legends API
- The League of Legends client offers a clunky experience for those looking to view skins for their favorite champions. It also provides only splash images, with no way to view how the skin looks in-game
- This app remedies the issue by allowing users to quickly look up their desired champion and view all of their skins on a single page. It also provides links to detailed in-game videos of each skin, making it easy to determine the in-game quality of the skin

## Technologies Used

- React
- Axios
- Express
- npm
- [League of Legends API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol)

```bash
# Go into the root directory
$ cd League-of-Skins

# Start the proxy server

# Go into the client directory

$ npm start
```
